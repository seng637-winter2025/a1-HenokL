# Introduction

In this lab, we evaluated an ATM simulation system using two methods: exploratory testing (unscripted, curiosity-driven testing) and manual functional testing (structured, scripted test cases). Our goal was to uncover defects, compare testing strategies, and practice using tools like Jira for defect tracking.

### What We Knew Before the Lab:
Before starting, we had a basic understanding of:

- Exploratory Testing: A flexible, ad-hoc approach where software testers learn the system on-the-fly and design tests dynamically. We imagined it would feel like "detective work" to find hidden bugs.

- Manual Functional Testing: A methodical process using predefined test cases. We assumed it would feel more systematic but less creative.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
